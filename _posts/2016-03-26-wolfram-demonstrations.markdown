Since the very beginning at my University training I have been intensively using Wolfram Mathematica. It is a fundamental tool for solving any high level mathematical problem and a powerful tool for visualization. Among other many powerful features, are the demonstrations, where you can create interactive renderings as shown in the examples below.<!--more-->

The first example was a challenge from our Calculus professor which consisted in creating a model of a helical staircase using only Mathematica which I decided to create having it plotted entirely using parametrical functions.

The second example was more of a personal desire to create a simple and intuitive tool to be used in lectures of Statics, more precisely on how the representation of the Mohr's circle is affected when rotating our reference coordinate system.
